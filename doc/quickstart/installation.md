# Installation

Grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/zorbathut/dec/releases/latest). If you prefer to work from an unreleased version, download the source and discard everything except `dec/src`.

## Unity

Copy every `.cs` file into Assets/ThirdParty/dec. When you're done, it should look something like this:

<img src="installation_unity.png">

(You can put them wherever you want, this is just a good default.)

## Godot

Copy every `.cs` file into ThirdParty/dec. When you're done, it should look something like this:

<img src="installation_godot.png">

(You can put them wherever you want, this is just a good default.)

## Other

Copy every `.cs` file into some directory that will be compiled into your project. The details will depend on your environment; we recommend putting it in a ThirdParty subdirectory to make later updates easier.
