# Installation

At this point in development, we recommend installing Def by simply copying the source files into your project.

## Unity

Copy every `.cs` file from `def/src` into Assets/ThirdParty/def. When you're done, it should look something like this:

<img src="installation_unity.png">

(You can put them wherever you want, this is just a good default.)

## Godot

Copy every `.cs` file from `def/src` into ThirdParty/def. When you're done, it should look something like this:

<img src="installation_godot.png">

(You can put them wherever you want, this is just a good default.)

## Other

Copy every `.cs` file from `def/src` into some directory that will be compiled into your project. The details will depend on your environment; we recommend putting it in a ThirdParty subdirectory to make later updates easier.
