def is an asset definition library written in C# and intended for games. It is inspired by the class hierarchy of the same name from Rimworld, although it has no code in common.

### Documentation

To the best of my knowledge, nobody but me has looked at this codebase with any intent on use. I haven't yet written documentation; if this looks like a useful library to you, get in contact with me and I'll put together some docs for you.

Otherwise I'll probably do so once I've used it in an experimental project or two.
